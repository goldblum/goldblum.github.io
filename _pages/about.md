ðŸš¨ **Note**: I am recruiting PhD students.  Reach out if you're interested. ðŸš¨

I am an assistant professor at Columbia University. My research focuses on both applied and fundamental problems in machine learning:  

1.  **AI safety** - Modern AI systems contain biases, security vulnerabilities, expose users to privacy breaches, and exhibit catastrophic failures of reasoning and generalization.  My work aims to detect and close these gaps.  

2.  **Mathematical and computational tools for understanding and improving neural networks** - Despite rapid advances in capabilities, our understanding of why neural networks work is highly limited.  My research focuses on the structures in neural networks and their training procedures that enable them to generalize in practice.  

3.  **Deep learning for data science and tabular data** - Vast communities of AI researchers study language and vision applications, yet most industrial and scientific data is tabular, and relatively few researchers study deep learning for tabular data.  My research aims to build useful deep learning tools for data science.  

My portfolio includes work in Bayesian inference, generalization theory, algorithmic reasoning, and AI security and privacy.  Our recent paper on model comparison received the Outstanding Paper Award at ICML 2022.  Before my current position, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at New York University working with [Yann LeCun](https://yann.lecun.com/) and [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/).  I received a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Maryland where I worked with [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) and [Wojciech Czaja](https://www.math.umd.edu/~czaja/).
