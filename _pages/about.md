[]: # (ðŸš¨ **Note**: I am recruiting PhD students, primarily for programs in computer science and electrical engineering.  Reach out if you're interested. ðŸš¨)

I am an assistant professor at Columbia University. My research focuses on both applied and fundamental problems in machine learning including AI safety, automated data science, training and inference strategies for large-scale models, and building a mathematical and also scientific understanding of why complex AI systems work.

My portfolio includes work in Bayesian inference, generalization theory, algorithmic reasoning, and AI security and privacy.  Our recent paper on model comparison received the Outstanding Paper Award at ICML 2022.  Before my current position, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at New York University working with [Yann LeCun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WLN3QrAAAAAJ) and [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/).  I received a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Maryland where I worked with [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) and [Wojciech Czaja](https://www.math.umd.edu/~czaja/).
